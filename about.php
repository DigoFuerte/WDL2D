            <h3>Claudius Ptolemy</h3>
        <p>Ptolemy, Latin in full Claudius Ptolemaeus, (born c. 100 CEâ€”died c. 170 CE), was an Egyptian astronomer, mathematician, and geographer of Greek descent who liveded in Alexandria during the 2nd century CE. His writings represent the culminating achievement of several fields of Greco-Roman science. In particular, his geocentric (Earth-centred) model of the universe (now known as the Ptolemaic system) is considered the main basis for these ideas that persisted for centuries.</p>
        <p>Although these ideas have been thoroughly debunked in modern times, Ptolemy is still considered an important figure in the history of astronomy. He is thought to be one of the first astronomers to produce a compendium of constellations which drew material from many sources of his era. In his book "The Almagest" he has produced a mathematical and astronomical treatise on the apparent motions of the stars and planetary paths and,  is famously noted for having listing 48 constellations.</p>
        <p>Ptolemy is an outstanding example of man's endeavour to understand the universe in which we exist. It is fitting that this website is named for Ptolemy as he represents the enduring spirit that still drives man to explore the universe.</p>
